## Project Overview

This is a React-based backend management system developed with a modern frontend tech stack, aiming to provide an efficient and user-friendly management interface. The project includes features such as user authentication, data display, and chart analysis, making it suitable for various management system developments.

## Tech Stack

- **create-react-app**: A scaffolding tool for quickly setting up a React project.
- **react-router-dom**: Manages frontend routing for seamless navigation between pages.
- **react-redux and redux-toolkit**: State management, centralizing the management of the application's global state.
- **axios**: A secondary encapsulation of HTTP requests to simplify API usage.
- **Ant Design UI**: An enterprise-level UI design language providing a rich set of components to enhance the user interface experience.
- **mock.js**: Used for data simulation, avoiding dependencies on backend interfaces and enhancing development efficiency.
- **Echarts**: For data visualization, enabling chart analyses.
